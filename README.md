# Samuel Oliveira Portfolio

**Welcome to my GitHub portfolio. Here you’ll find links to my most relevant projects in cybersecurity, web development, programming, networking, and hardware.**

## About Me

I’m a cybersecurity student specializing in pentesting, web security, and DevOps. With a background in software development and databases, I approach security end‑to‑end — from code to infrastructure. I build practical tools, document reproducible findings, and focus on ethical, authorized testing. I’m currently sharpening my skills in vulnerability assessment, AppSec, and network security through hands‑on projects.
